# 6.20 Meeting Records

### Preflight: 

- The "2% error" Yue has made: the false-positive rate is not that huge. It can be very small. 

  >A `BinaryFuse8` filter uses ≈9 bits per entry of the set is it constructed from, and has a false-positive rate of ≈2^-8 (<0.4%).\
  >
  >A `Fuse32` filter uses <36.404 bits per entry of the set is it constructed from, and has a false-positive rate of effectively zero (1/2^32 =~ 1/4 billion).

- SparsePIR and Cuckoo hashing method.

  - SparsePIR is using multiplications.
  - Cuckoo hashing is the same as we thought. But Sparse PIR is faster, and has smaller response size.
